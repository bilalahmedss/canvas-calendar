# 📅 Canvas to Calendar Bot (Smart Edition)

This tool automatically pulls your Assignments, Announcements, and Events from Canvas and syncs them to your Google/Apple Calendar. 

**✨ New Features:**
* **Auto-Sync:** Updates every day at 5:00 AM.
* **Smart Parsing:** If a professor posts "Quiz on the 28th" in an announcement, this bot moves it to the correct date automatically.
* **"Next Class" Logic:** If an announcement says "Quiz next class," the bot checks your personal timetable and figures out the exact date.
