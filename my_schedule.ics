DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/5111/discussion_topics/62168\n\nHi all\,\nI’ve uploaded the first programming assignment. This assignment wraps up the mathematical foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs). This assignment will be due February 15th at 11:59 PM (two weeks from now).\nThe assignments will be guided and relatively straightforward. That said\, I strongly recommend starting early. Fully understanding what’s being asked will take some time. Completing the assignments carefully will also prepare you well for the quizzes and the midterm.\nStarting this week\, we’ll focus exclusively on neural models for language modeling. From there\, we’ll gradually build toward sequence-to-sequence translation\, which will motivate our transition to Attention-based models.\nBest\,Usama

Five Tribes of ML and why Generative AI ≠ predictive modeling for tasks like ranking and forecasting - &nbsp\;The concept of moat / USP in AI products (why “just an API + prompt” isn’t enough) - High-level LLM application stack (data pipelines\, vector DBs\, caching\, hosting)\n2. Dr. Abdella' Guest lecture on Transformers: tokenization\, embeddings\, attention\, masking\, and encoder–decoder architecture&nbsp\;\nQuiz update: The next class quiz will be based on BOTH my lecture and the guest lecture. Please re-watch the full lecture recording and review the Transformer concepts carefully.\nAssignment 1 — Token Counter Tool:\nBuild a tool that takes input text + a selected LLM model (any 3 models) and outputs the token count.CLI/terminal-based is fine (UI optional).Submit as a PUBLIC GitHub repository with a clear README.Due: Sunday night 1/25 - 11:59pm (before next class).\nThanks\,Adnan

DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/4981/discussion_topics/62217\n\nDear Class\,\nHere’s a quick recap of what we covered in Lecture #4 and what you need to do for the upcoming assignment.\nKey topics from yesterday\n1) Agentic AI: why it changes the risk picture\n\nWe discussed how agentic AI increases the attack surface compared to “classic” GenAI/chatbots because agents can take actions via tools (e.g.\, accessing files/drive\, sending emails/SMS\, making outbound calls\, running workflows\, etc.).\nThis means failures can move from “bad text output” to real-world actions taken on a user’s/organization’s behalf.\n\n2) Safety vs. Security (and how to tell the difference)\n\nSafety = preventing unintentional harm (intent/behavior control).\n\nExamples in agentic AI: misaligned goals\, runaway actions\, unintended harmful outcomes.\nControls: alignment\, guardrails\, constraints\, stop conditions\, human-in-the-loop.\n\nSecurity = defending against deliberate threats (access/abuse control).\n\nExamples in agentic AI: prompt injection\, account/tool hijacking\, data exfiltration\, abuse of permissions.\nControls: authentication/authorization\, sandboxing\, secrets isolation\, least privilege tools.\n\nWe also highlighted that bias is primarily a safety concern (intrinsic to the system’s behavior)\, even though safety/security can sometimes overlap.\n\n3) Industry frameworks you should know (and use as checklists)\nWe reviewed three key references you’ll use to reason about and test systems:\n\nOWASP Top 10 (Web App Security) — common web application risks like injection\, misconfigurations\, broken access control\, etc.\nOWASP Top 10 (LLM Applications) — LLM-specific risks like prompt injection\, sensitive info disclosure\, excessive agency\, training data poisoning\, etc.\nMITRE ATLAS / ATLAS Matrix — a threat matrix/framework for AI/ML systems covering attacker behaviors (recon → access → execution → exfiltration → impact).\n\nWe also walked through examples like:\n\nTraining data poisoning (poisoned training or fine-tuning data impacting model behavior).\nA multi-turn jailbreak (“crescendo”) example to illustrate how prompt injection can gradually steer a model toward disallowed outputs.\n\n4) Hyperscalers &amp\; Responsible AI tooling (Azure / AWS / GCP)\nWe talked through how major cloud platforms provide built-in capabilities for:\n\ncontent safety filters\, prompt defense\, evaluations\, explainability\, monitoring\, and transparency\nred teaming (authorized “attack simulation” to test defenses)\n\nWe also mentioned major standards:\n\nNIST AI RMF\, ISO 42001\, and EU AI Act (noting the EU AI Act is enforceable law\, unlike most guidance/frameworks).\n\n&nbsp\;\nThe details for this week's assignment are available here: A3: LLM Security Helper App.\nLecture slides have been added to the week 4 module and the supplemental material for this week is available here: Readings &amp\; Supplemental Material.\nIf you have questions\, reach out to the course RAs&nbsp\;or message the instructor.\n&nbsp\;\nBest\,CS 435 Team

You can find the Office Hours and the Weekly Readings in the General module. The content for Week 1 will be shared shortly.\nHere are certain rules for this course:\n\nJoin on time\; punctuality matters. &nbsp\;\nKeep your camera on to encourage engagement and better interaction with the professor. &nbsp\;\nMute your mic unless it’s your turn to speak. &nbsp\;\nUse “Raise Hand” to signal when you want to contribute. &nbsp\;\nStay focused—no multitasking during class. &nbsp\;\nPause briefly when speaking to keep everyone in sync. &nbsp\;\nUse a neutral background for a professional appearance. &nbsp\;\nPosition your camera at eye level for better virtual eye contact. &nbsp\;\nTest your audio and video before class starts.\nQuizzes will be in person. Anyone who attempts them from outside of the designated venue will not be marked.\n\nP.S. Your attendance for the last class has been marked on PSCS.\nRegards\,CS435 Team

I will also be uploading the first assignment in the next few days. I advise you to please activate your Piazza accounts if you haven't done so already. I have resent the activation emails.\nBest\,Usama

DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/5111/discussion_topics/61661\n\nDear All\,\nA few updates:\n\nI have uploaded the slides for our first lecture (January 14th). You can find all uploads under the Files section on Canvas. If you find any typos in any of my slides\, do reach out!\nI learnt that some students found the pace of the first lecture a bit fast. I am happy to review the concepts in the next lecture.\nI have decided to use Piazza as a discussion platform for this course. In my opinion\, it provides a richer discussion experience than the one provided by Canvas. You should have received an invitation to set up your Piazza account.\nI’m also working on getting it integrated with Canvas (such that you see a Piazza tab). That being said\, you can always access it directly from piazza.com (just login using your habib.edu.pk email).\n\nBest\,Usama

I have just uploaded combined slides for lectures 4-6 (i.e. Monday January 26th - Monday February 2nd). These include concepts which were covered as Python demos.\nAll the concepts you will be tested on are in the slides for Lectures 1 through 6.\nI will also upload slides for today's session (Lecture 7)\, although it will not be tested in the quiz. More precisely\, today's session was a review session\, however\, we did go over the LSTM\, and what extra abilities it has\, over regular RNNs.\nOf the topics we have covered previously\, backpropagation and regularization will not be tested in the quiz.\nBest\,Usama
