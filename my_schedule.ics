DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/5040/discussion_topics/62395\n\n\nDear All\,\nThe following rubric will be used for mid-evaluations of your capstone projects:\n\n\n\nCategory\nMax Score\nAbove Average (8-10 for Design\, 16-20 for Demo\, etc.)\nAverage (6-8 for Design\, 12-16 for Demo\, etc.)\nBelow Average (0-6 for Design\, 0-12 for Demo\, etc.)\n\n\nProgress\n10\nThe Group has demonstrated strong progress by achieving most planned milestones for this stage. Work completed so far is coherent\, well-organized\, and clearly aligned with the project objectives. The team can clearly justify what has been implemented and why.\nThe Group has made reasonable progress and completed several milestones. However\, progress is uneven\, and some completed work appears ad hoc or insufficiently justified. There is partial clarity about what has been achieved and what remains.\nThe Group has shown limited progress\, with few meaningful milestones achieved. Work completed so far lacks direction or coherence\, and there is little clarity about current status or rationale behind the work done.\n\n\nWorking Demo\n20\nThe major functionalities have been completed. All components should be integrated and functional. The test plan has been created and executed.\nCore functionalities have been implemented\, but some may still have minor issues or require refinement. Most components are integrated\, but some may not work seamlessly together. A test plan has been created\, but execution is incomplete or reveals issues that remain unresolved.\nOnly partial implementation of core functionalities\, with major features missing or non-functional. Components are not fully integrated\, leading to significant gaps in functionality. A test plan is missing\, incomplete\, or has not been executed\, making it difficult to assess system performance.\n\n\nRemaining Work\n5\nThe team has shown excellent progress so far and has achieved many milestones. They are clear about the work yet to be completed and can comfortably complete it in time.\nThe team has shown good progress and achieved significant milestones. However\, much work remains\, and they need to pace up. Some components are still vague.\nThe team has not shown good progress. Most important milestones remain unachieved\, and there is no clarity about outstanding tasks\, making completion difficult.\n\n\nPresentation Skills\n7\nThe project is properly introduced. The content is well-organized and presented coherently in an interesting manner. Time was properly managed.\nThe project is properly introduced. The content is reasonably organized and presented coherently. Some information was missing or vague.\nThe project is poorly introduced. The content is disorganized with missing or vague key information.\n\n\nQ&amp\;A\n8\nGroup members were well prepared to answer the questions and showed good knowledge on the topics. They did not leave any room for ambiguity.\nGroup members were prepared to answer questions and showed basic knowledge on the topics. Some ambiguity remained.\nGroup members were not well-prepared to answer questions\, showed limited knowledge\, and left much room for ambiguity.\n\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/5111/discussion_topics/62168\n\nHi all\,\nI’ve uploaded the first programming assignment. This assignment wraps up the mathematical foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs). This assignment will be due February 15th at 11:59 PM (two weeks from now).\nThe assignments will be guided and relatively straightforward. That said\, I strongly recommend starting early. Fully understanding what’s being asked will take some time. Completing the assignments carefully will also prepare you well for the quizzes and the midterm.\nStarting this week\, we’ll focus exclusively on neural models for language modeling. From there\, we’ll gradually build toward sequence-to-sequence translation\, which will motivate our transition to Attention-based models.\nBest\,Usama

DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/4981/discussion_topics/62217\n\nDear Class\,\nHere’s a quick recap of what we covered in Lecture #4 and what you need to do for the upcoming assignment.\nKey topics from yesterday\n1) Agentic AI: why it changes the risk picture\n\nWe discussed how agentic AI increases the attack surface compared to “classic” GenAI/chatbots because agents can take actions via tools (e.g.\, accessing files/drive\, sending emails/SMS\, making outbound calls\, running workflows\, etc.).\nThis means failures can move from “bad text output” to real-world actions taken on a user’s/organization’s behalf.\n\n2) Safety vs. Security (and how to tell the difference)\n\nSafety = preventing unintentional harm (intent/behavior control).\n\nExamples in agentic AI: misaligned goals\, runaway actions\, unintended harmful outcomes.\nControls: alignment\, guardrails\, constraints\, stop conditions\, human-in-the-loop.\n\nSecurity = defending against deliberate threats (access/abuse control).\n\nExamples in agentic AI: prompt injection\, account/tool hijacking\, data exfiltration\, abuse of permissions.\nControls: authentication/authorization\, sandboxing\, secrets isolation\, least privilege tools.\n\nWe also highlighted that bias is primarily a safety concern (intrinsic to the system’s behavior)\, even though safety/security can sometimes overlap.\n\n3) Industry frameworks you should know (and use as checklists)\nWe reviewed three key references you’ll use to reason about and test systems:\n\nOWASP Top 10 (Web App Security) — common web application risks like injection\, misconfigurations\, broken access control\, etc.\nOWASP Top 10 (LLM Applications) — LLM-specific risks like prompt injection\, sensitive info disclosure\, excessive agency\, training data poisoning\, etc.\nMITRE ATLAS / ATLAS Matrix — a threat matrix/framework for AI/ML systems covering attacker behaviors (recon → access → execution → exfiltration → impact).\n\nWe also walked through examples like:\n\nTraining data poisoning (poisoned training or fine-tuning data impacting model behavior).\nA multi-turn jailbreak (“crescendo”) example to illustrate how prompt injection can gradually steer a model toward disallowed outputs.\n\n4) Hyperscalers &amp\; Responsible AI tooling (Azure / AWS / GCP)\nWe talked through how major cloud platforms provide built-in capabilities for:\n\ncontent safety filters\, prompt defense\, evaluations\, explainability\, monitoring\, and transparency\nred teaming (authorized “attack simulation” to test defenses)\n\nWe also mentioned major standards:\n\nNIST AI RMF\, ISO 42001\, and EU AI Act (noting the EU AI Act is enforceable law\, unlike most guidance/frameworks).\n\n&nbsp\;\nThe details for this week's assignment are available here: A3: LLM Security Helper App.\nLecture slides have been added to the week 4 module and the supplemental material for this week is available here: Readings &amp\; Supplemental Material.\nIf you have questions\, reach out to the course RAs&nbsp\;or message the instructor.\n&nbsp\;\nBest\,CS 435 Team

In case you're interested please reach out.\nQalb\nProject\nGoal:Surpass current Urdu SOTA by improving on Qalb using Qwen as the base.\n1. Model Strategy\nUse a stronger Qwen base model (7B/14B+).\nPerform continued pretraining on high-quality Urdu corpus.\nPreserve multilingual capability (avoid catastrophic forgetting).\n2. Data Requirements\nBuild clean\, deduplicated Urdu corpus (≥2B tokens target).\nNormalize Unicode\, handle Nastaliq variants.\nInclude diverse domains: news\, literature\, legal\, finance\, conversational.\nAdd difficult reasoning and long-context samples.\n3. Tokenizer Optimization\nTrain or adapt tokenizer optimized for Urdu morphology.\nReduce subword fragmentation.\nValidate token efficiency empirically.\n4. Training Phases\nPhase 1: Continued pretraining (Urdu-heavy).\nPhase 2: Instruction fine-tuning (Urdu instructions).\nPhase 3: Preference tuning (DPO/ORPO).\n5. Evaluation\nReproduce Qalb benchmarks.\nAdd harder reasoning + code-mix tasks.\nRun ablation studies.\nDocument measurable improvement.\n6. Deliverables\nTrained model.\nTraining logs + hyperparameters.\nData documentation.\nEvaluation report.\nError analysis.\nSuccess Criteria\nClear benchmark improvement.\nStrong reasoning in Urdu.\nReduced hallucinations.\nStable multilingual behavior.\nThis is a research-grade effort.Quality of data + rigor of evaluation will determine success.

DESCRIPTION:Link: https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/4981/discussion_topics/62376\n\nDear Class\,\nWe want to share an important update regarding class participation and attendance expectations for this course.\nOver the past few sessions\, inconsistent attendance and limited responsiveness during live classes has been observed. This course is designed to be highly interactive\, discussion-driven\, and participatory. Active engagement is not optional—it is a core part of the learning experience and essential to achieving the course outcomes.\nEffective immediately\, camera-on participation during live class sessions will be required.Students who attend with cameras off will be marked absent\, except in cases of documented or pre-approved exceptions.\nThis policy is being introduced to:\n* Ensure meaningful engagement and accountability* Support interactive discussions\, cold-calling\, and real-time feedback* Maintain fairness and consistency across the class\nI recognize that genuine constraints can arise. If you have a legitimate reason (technical\, medical\, or personal) that prevents camera-on participation\, please discuss it with me directly in advance\, and we will handle it reasonably on a case-by-case basis.\nWhile this expectation would ideally have been stated in the syllabus upfront\, it is still well within instructional norms\, and it aligns with the collaborative\, discussion-oriented nature of this course.\nI appreciate your cooperation and professionalism as we move forward. My goal is to ensure a high-quality learning environment where everyone benefits fully from the experience.\nBest regards\,CS435 RAs\nOn behalf of Dr. Adnan Masood

You just need to add links to this sheet. Since assignment 5 was a class activity\, we expect that you should have done this during the class\, hence\, two assignments for the week.\nFor assignment 6\, you have 3 parts:\n\nAI horror story (you will be presenting it in class + submitting a small write-up on what you are presenting in class)&nbsp\;\na resume for an ethical AI job&nbsp\;\narchitecture diagram (a scenario has been assigned to each of you and details can be found here)&nbsp\;\n\nIf you have any questions\, feel free to reach out to either me or Sarim.\nBest\,\nCS 435 Team

This page should also show on the Home page under announcements. From now on\, you are expected to follow this page instead of the "Files" tab.\nThis is different from the "Course Syllabus" tab which simply takes you to SimpleSyllabus.\nBest\,Usama
